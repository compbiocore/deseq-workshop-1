### Workshop Topics

This workshop, 'Analyses of RNA-seq and ChiP-seq with R/Bioconductor', is designed to expand upon the Bioconductor training provided in the first Bioconductor workshop; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  The topics presented herein include the following:

* Standard exploratory analyses for RNA-seq Data
   * Approaches to processing raw data from RNA seq experiments
   * Annotating and importing expression counts
   * Cleaning data / removing artefacts
   * Transformations for improving model fit
   * PCA and MDS plotting
   * Box plots for between-sample distribution comparison
